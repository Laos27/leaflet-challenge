# leaflet-challenge

Background (taken from Module 15 Challenge)
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet

The code for this challenge can be found inside the folder static, in the folder js: logic.js.

The objective of this challenge was to create an Earthquake Visualisation using Leaflet, by plotting all the earthquakes from (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) based on their longitude and latitude.

The visualisation includes popups that provide additional information about each specific earthquake such as Location, Time, Magnitude and Depth.
